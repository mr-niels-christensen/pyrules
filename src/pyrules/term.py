'''
Methods for validating and matching terms.
We allow three kinds of terms:
  - A variable, represented as a unicode or a str without whitespaces,
    and beginning with a capital letter. Examples: 'X', 'Distance'
  - An atom, represented as a unicode or a str without whitespaces,
    beginning with anything but a capital letter. Examples: 'bob', 'Â¬'
  - An iterable of valid terms. Example: ('parent', 'alice', 'bob').
    The empty iterable is a valid term.

                       b.bind('X', 'a')
                       substitute(('cons', X', 'X'), b) == ('cons', 'a', 'a')  
       @param term: Any valid term. (If not valid, an InvalidTerm will be raised).

       @return: A copy of term with every occurrence of a variable bound in binding
                replace by the term it is bound to.
