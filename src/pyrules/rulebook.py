    '''A Rulebook defines a recursive scheme for generating terms.
       The Rulebook contains a number of rules.
       Each rule has one term as its "conclusion", and zero or more
       terms as its "premises".
       
       Example: For every term generated by the Rulebook, the 1-premise rule
                    ('a', 'X') :- 'X'
                generates one new term. Say 'b' was generated by some other rule.
                Then ('a', 'b') will be generated by the above rule. So will ('a', ('a', 'b')), eventually.
       
       When each premise of a rule matches some already generated term, the rule can "fire",
       generating its conclusion term with its variables substituted by the bindings
       obtained from the matches.
       
       A number of concrete examples will appear in the test package.

           use a chain of "premise" method calls to the return value like this:
             rb.rule(conclusion).premise(premise0).premise(premise1).premise(2)
           The premise methods use the same notation discussed for param conclusion below.
           @param conclusion: The conclusion of the rule.
           If exactly one value is passed to this method, the new rule's conclusion
           will be that term.
           If more than one value is passed, the conclusion will be a tuple with the given
           values as elements.
           Example: rb.rule('a', 'X') adds a rule with the term ('a', 'X') as its conclusion.
           Example: rb.rule('X') adds a rule with the term 'X' as its conclusion (not the tuple ('X')).
           @return: An object with a method premise() for adding a premise to the new rule.
           This method will also return an object that implements premise() so calls can be chained.
           The notation for premise terms is the same as for the conclusion term.
